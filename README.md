# Leaflet + Mapbox - Visualizing Earthquake Data
## Earthquake data based on latitude, longitude and magnitude


### Synopsis
An interactive map using Leaflet and Mapbox to plot earthquakes location and seismic intensity of the last 7 days by longitude, latitude and magnitude. In this map the user can switch between three different types of maps and quickly understand which earthquakes have the highest magnitude by the circle's color and size. 


### Visualizations

• Mapbox
• choropleth.js
• html + js
• GeoJSON

### Deployment

The map can be visualized in this github page: https://bit.ly/3978bE1
Or in any browser. Just download the files and run locally. 



#### About the Data

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. It can be used by anyone here: [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). When you click on a data set, for example 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days', you will be given a JSON representation of that data.

This project was part of UCF Data Analytics & Visualization boot camp program
